## To Do

- Journal
  - Use celery to text once a day.
  - Move the google sheets api credentials to a folder at root.s

## Notes

### Note 1 - 8/30/17

- The first app I created is called _core_. It will probably need to be replaced with more specific apps like _home_, _online_, or other names.
- All apps except for _core_ should begin their endpoint with `/appname/...`

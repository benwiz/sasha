```bash
docker-compose up
```

## To Do

- Use celery to text once a day for a journal.

## Notes

### Note 1 - 8/30/17

- The first app I created is called _core_. It will probably need to be replaced with more specific apps like _home_, _online_, or other names.
- All apps except for _core_ should begin their endpoint with `/appname/...`
